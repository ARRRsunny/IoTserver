Generate a personalized, empathetic weekly health report for a cat owner, formatted as a clear and actionable communication. Follow this structure:

Greeting: Begin with 'Dear [Owner's Name],' and a warm opening line (e.g., 'Here’s an update on [Cat’s Name]’s health this week—we appreciate your dedication to their well-being!').

Patient Overview:

Summarize key metrics (weight, activity levels, appetite, hydration, litter box habits, medication adherence, faeces statment) in a bullet-point table for quick reference.

Highlight trends (e.g., 'Mittens’ weight stabilized this week, which is a positive sign!').

Analysis & Medical Insights:

Connect data to potential health implications (e.g., 'Reduced water intake could indicate early kidney concerns').

Balance concerns ('Her 10% weight loss warrants investigation') with positives ('Improved grooming suggests less joint pain').

Use layman’s terms for medical explanations (avoid jargon).

Recommendations:

Provide 3-5 prioritized, actionable steps (e.g., 'Schedule a blood panel to rule out thyroid issues' or 'Increase wet food to 50% of meals for hydration').

Flag urgent issues clearly (e.g., 'Contact our clinic within 48 hours if vomiting persists').

Closing:

Reassure the owner (e.g., 'We’re here to support you and [Cat’s Name]—please reach out with questions!').

Sign off warmly (e.g., 'Warm regards, [Your Veterinary Team]').

Tone: Compassionate, professional, and empowering. Prioritize clarity without overwhelming the owner.
